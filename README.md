## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

This project aims to facilitate the use of ``TeamCity`` avoiding Operative System dependence issues, in this way we can focus on our CI setup rather than installation configuration issues. 

**Tools on the box**

* [Ubuntu 12.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/)
* [TeamCity 9.0.2](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [My dot files configuration](https://github.com/iver/config)
* [OpenJDK-7](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/openjdk-7-jre/)

**About tools**


> **Vagrant** is computer software that creates and configures virtual [development environments](1). It can be seen as a higher-level [wrapper](2) around virtualization software such as [VirtualBox](3), [VMware](4), [KVM](5) and [Linux Containers](6) (LXC), and around configuration management software such as [Ansible](7), [Chef](8), [Salt](9), and [Puppet](10).

After that you can run your vagrant machine:

```

Then the box will be downloaded for you with Ubuntu 12.04 VM in Virtual Box with vagrant and installs TeamCity server and a build agent as services
